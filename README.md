# recipebox
Author: Ally Engle
Note the repo name change to try to deter the clone of my repo: 20 unique clones and 44 clones to date since last friday. Last night, Friday, August 21st, 7 uniques and 7 clones within an 1-1/2 of making it public again!

IMPORTANT NOTE: I use "python3 manage.py <insert command>." My computer seems to be particular about using python3 for everything related to python 3.x.x and running django.
Sources used (so far) for assistance and understanding(links included):
1. Kenzie Recipebox V.1, Forms, and Auth Demo by Joe! The main one since he basically walked through it, only this one is about recipes and we had to do a recipe_detail instead of article_detail. Only difference.
  
  Citation notes:
  
  [V1/2]Citations for code blocks done for V.1 and the part 2: Forms Assessment.
  
  [Auth]Recipebox part 3: Auth demo by Joe: This was walked through beginning to end wll cite every part that was from that demo with [Auth]
