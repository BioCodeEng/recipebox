IMPORTANT NOTE: I use "python3 manage.py <insert command>." My computer seems to be particular about using python3 for everything related to python 3.x.x and running django.
Sources used (so far) for assistance and understanding(links included):
1. Kenzie Recipebox V.1, Forms, and Auth Demo by Joe! The main one since he basically walked through it, only this one is about recipes and we had to do a recipe_detail instead of author_detail. Only difference.

Also helpful sources in expanding upon my understanding and learning:
